# OpenJSMSOJ
This is an open source version of the Online Judge System project in JSMS. 

**Note**: We shall add that the project hasn't started yet and still remains a concept.

**Developments in Future**: The project is expected to be written in C#, aiming to provide a more convenient judging environment for the OI team in our school.
